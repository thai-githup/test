<div style="font-family:Arial;font-size:13px;line-height:16px;color:#000000;">
<div>Long ago there was a small kingdom at the foot of the Nilgiri</div>
<div>Hills. It was called Shangrila and was ruled by a wise and gentle</div>
<div>king, Rishi Raj. The king was kind, just and loved by his people.</div>
<div>Shangrila was a beautiful place dotted with gardens and greenery.</div>
<div>Flowers bloomed throughout the year, birds chirped and animals</div>
<div>frolicked in gay abandon. Love and peace reigned supreme.</div>
<div>According to a legend all this was because of Kokila&mdash;the</div>
<div>cuckoo bird. Kokila lived on a banyan tree that grew in a garden</div>
<div>in front of the King's palace. Kokila was blind but she had an</div>
<div>enchating voice. She sang the whole day and her melodious voice</div>
<div>wafted across the kingdom spreading, love, peace and happiness.</div>
<div>On the other side of the Nilgiri Hills was another kingdom</div>
<div>called Dongrila. If Shangrila epitomized love, peace and joy,</div>
<div>Dongrila was the picture of hatred, infighting and misery. It was</div>
<div>ruled by Jagat Guru, a mean, ill tempered and selfish king</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="wb_Text2" style="position:absolute;left:17px;top:564px;width:395px;height:465px;z-index:3;">
<div style="font-family:Arial;font-size:13px;line-height:16px;color:#000000;">
<div>One day, Jagat Guru happened to pass through Shangrila.</div>
<div>He was greatly impressed by what he saw.</div>
<div>On reaching home he summoned his Prime Minister, Gyan deep.</div>
<div>&quot;Gyan, this morning, I passed through Shangrila. This was the</div>
<div>first time I had been there. It is a fantastic place. It is as pretty as</div>
<div>a picture, calm and peaceful.. It is like heaven. Find out how King</div>
<div>Rishi Raj manages to maintain his kingdom so well?&quot;</div>
<div>&quot;Yes, Maharaj?&quot; Gyan Deep bowed.</div>
<div>The same day, Gyan Deep left for Shangrila disguised as a hermit.</div>
<div>He spent his time in the kingdom talking to people, roaming the</div>
<div>streets and observing things minutely. Finally, after ten days, satisfied with the information he had collected, he returned to Dongrila.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="wb_Text3" style="position:absolute;left:411px;top:314px;width:387px;height:452px;z-index:4;">
<div style="font-family:Arial;font-size:13px;line-height:16px;color:#000000;">
<div>On the morning after his return, he went to meet the king in</div>
<div>his chamber. &quot;Maharaj I have found out the secret behind King</div>
<div>Rishi Raj's success.&quot;</div>
<div>&quot;What is it?&quot;</div>
<div>&quot;It is a bird called Kokila,&quot; Gyan Deep began and told the king</div>
<div>about the legend of Kokila.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;Then, I must somehow get this bird to Dongrila. Gyan, prepare</div>
<div>for war. Let us attack Shangrila and forcibly take the bird.&quot;</div>
<div>&quot;Maharaj, that would be unwise. You know in our army the</div>
<div>generals are busy fighting with each other. It is divided into many</div>
<div>factions, one opposing the other. Shangrila's army, on the other hand,</div>
<div>is strong and well-knit. Our army will never be able to vanquish it.&quot;</div>
<div>'Then what do you want me to do?&quot;</div>
<div>&quot;Go to Shangrila and request King Rishi Raj to lend you the</div>
<div>magical bird for a few days. He is a kind-hearted and magnanimous</div>
<div>king. I am sure he will agree.&quot;</div>
<div>&quot;Yes, I think I will do that.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<div id="wb_Text4" style="position:absolute;left:798px;top:10px;width:390px;height:852px;z-index:6;">
<div style="font-family:Arial;font-size:13px;line-height:16px;color:#000000;">
<div>A week later, Jagat Guru went to Shangrila with a lot of gifts for</div>
<div>King RishiRaj.</div>
<div>The king welcomed him with open arms and organized a grand</div>
<div>cultural programme followed by a lavish dinner in his honour.</div>
<div>The next day before leaving, Jagat Guru said to King Rishi Raj,</div>
<div>&quot;I have a small request to make.&quot;</div>
<div>&quot;Anything you ask is yours, my friend,&quot; King Rishi Raj</div>
<div>generously offered.</div>
<div>&quot;I want to borrow Kokila.&quot;</div>
<div>&quot;Kokila!&quot; King Rishi Raj was taken aback.</div>
<div>&quot;Yes, only for a few days. I want to use its magical presence to</div>
<div>bring peace and happiness in my kingdom.&quot;</div>
<div>Poor King, what could he do? He had already given his word to</div>
<div>Jagat Guru. He parted with Kokila, his heart heavy and eyes full</div>
<div>of tears. He also sent five of his most trusted soldiers to ensure</div>
<div>the safety and well being of Kokila.</div>
<div>As soon as the king reached his palace he put it in a golden cage.</div>
<div>&quot;Maharaj, please do not keep it in a cage. It is used to flying</div>
<div>free, please do not enslave it,&quot; the soldiers protested.</div>
<div>&quot;Shut up, you fools! Kokila is now my property. I will do what</div>
<div>I want with it!&quot; he thundered. Then turning to Gyan Deep he said,</div>
<div>'Throw these idiots into the dungeons. They will rot here for the</div>
<div>rest of their lives. Kokila is mine, and will be with me forever.&quot;</div>
<div>&quot;Maharaj, King Raj will not keep quiet...&quot; began Gyan Deep.</div>
<div>&quot;He will not attack Dongrila. He is a peace-loving fellow. For the</div>
<div>sake of a bird, he cannot risk the lives of hundreds of his soldiers.&quot;</div>
<div>Gyan Deep remained silent. He knew there was no point in</div>
<div>arguing with someone as stubborn as Jagat Guru.</div>
<div>And so, poor Kokila was kept in a golden cage and given the</div>
<div>choicest fruits to eat. But Kokila refused to sing. Jagat Guru</div>
<div>coaxed, cajoled, begged and even threatened her, but it was of no</div>
<div>use. Kokila just would not sing.</div>
<div>Jagat Guru started getting desperate. He called a number of</div>
<div>doctors and got them to examine Kokila. But there seemed</div>
<div>nothing wrong with the bird. Finally, he came to know of a wise</div>
<div>old man, said to be more than a hundred years old, who lived in a</div>
<div>tiny cottage on the Nilgiri Hills. His name was Prashant Baba.</div>
<div>One day, Jagat Guru went alone to Prashant Baba's ashram.</div>
<div>He saw a hermit, clad in white, sitting under a banyan tree</div>
<div>meditating. Though he had white hair and beard, his face was</div>
<div>very youthful. It had a kind of radiance Jagat Guru had never</div>
<div>seen in his life before. He touched Prashant Baba's feet and sat</div>
<div>down. After a few minutes sage opened his eyes. The king explained the purpose of his visit and told him the entire story.</div>
<div>The sage looked at him for a few minutes, then said, &quot;Do you really</div>
<div>believe Kokila is a magical bird.&quot;&quot;Yes, of course Baba, that is</div>
<div>why Shangrila is...&quot;&nbsp;&quot;You are a fool!&quot; Prashant Baba</div>
<div>cut him short.</div>
</div>

<div><span style="color:#008080;">Jagat Guru, the king of Dongrila, a fool!</span><span style="color:#008080;">&quot;</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#008080;">Jagat Guru got up, his hand reaching for</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#008080;">his sword. _ _</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#008080;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#008080;">Shut up and sit down,</span><span style="color:#008080;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#008080;"> commanded the Baba. There was so</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#008080;">much authority in his voice and such power in his gaze that Jagat</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#008080;">Guru sat down meekly.</span></div>
